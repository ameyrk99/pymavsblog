# PyMavs Blog

add new blog in `src/pages/` by creating new folders and putting all the markdown, imgages, etc files related to that page in the folder

Each markdown file must contain at the start:

```markdown
---
title: SomeTitle
date: "SomeDate (format: yyyy-mm-dd)"
---
```

When you're done, preview using `gatsby develop` and depoly the website using `npm run deploy`. Your changes are pushed to the gh-pages branch. 

__Push it to master once you depoly__.
